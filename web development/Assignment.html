				<h3>E-Waste Recycling</h3>
				
				<p>
					<img src="img/E-waste.jpg" alt="#">
					

				 
				 <br>
				 

					Electronic waste or e-waste describes discarded electrical or electronic<br> devices.It is also commonly known as waste electrical and electronic <br>  equipment (WEEE)<br> or end-of-life (EOL) electronics.<br> Used electronics which are destined for refurbishment,<br> reuse, resale, salvage recycling through material recovery, <br>
					or disposal are also considered e-waste.

				<h3>Lithium Battery Recycling</h3>
				
				<p>
					<img src="img/Li-on.png" alt="#">
					
					<br>
					
					
Lithium-ion batteries contain metals such as cobalt, nickel, and manganese, which<br> are toxic and can contaminate <br> water supplies and ecosystems if they leach out of landfills. Additionally, fires in<br> landfills or battery-recycling <br>facilities have been attributed to inappropriate disposal of lithium-ion batteries

		<h2 id="heading-recycle">How to recycle E-Waste ?</h2>
		<br>
		<br>

		<img src="img/e-waste-management.png" alt="#">
		<br>
		<br>

		<p>
			The first step in processing e-waste involves manual sorting to extract specific items, such as batteries and bulbs, for their own processing. During this stage, certain items may be dismantled by hand to recover valuable materials or components for reuse.

After manual sorting, e-waste is shredded into small pieces to facilitate the precise sorting of materials. This is a critical stage of the process since electronics typically consist of various materials that can be separated mechanically when broken down into centimeter-sized pieces.
<br>
<br>


		</p>

		<h2>Magnetic Seperation</h2>
		<br>
		<br>
		<img src="img/magnetic.jpg" alt="#">
		<br>
		<p>
			The e-waste is shredded and subjected to magnetic separation to extract ferrous metals like iron and steel, while non-ferrous metals are separated using eddy currents. These metals are then sent to specialized recycling facilities for smelting. Other materials, such as circuit boards and metal-embedded plastic, are separated during this stage.
			<br>
<br>




		</p>

		<h2>Seperation by Water</h2>
		<br>
		<img src="img/seperator.jpg" alt="#">
		<p>
			After magnetic separation, the remaining solid waste primarily consists of plastic and glass. To further purify the waste and separate different types of plastic, water is used in a subsequent separation step. Obvious contaminants are also hand-sorted during this process.
		</p>
		<br>
<br>

		<h2>Recovery</h2>
		<br>
		<img src="img/recovery.jpg" alt="#">
		<br>
		<br>

		<p>Once separated, the materials are readied for reuse and sale. Certain materials, like plastic or steel, are directed to other recycling streams. However, others can be processed onsite and sold directly, along with usable components extracted during earlier stages of the recycling process.</p>
